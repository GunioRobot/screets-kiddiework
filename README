		* Each object can store 1 million different FILE IDS in /srv directory
		  (256 directory and just 4000 files under per directory)
		  
			> For example each product object in ONE STORE can have 1 million file id 
			  (that means product object in another store can have 1 million file ids as well, 
			   and also another object, category can have 1 million file under per store directory.)
			  
			> An ID has different names while using in files (for example image files):
				c64b0d3cae2f874df24d21d00e49cdee_thumb.jpg   // Thumbnail version of image file
				c64b0d3cae2f874df24d21d00e49cdee_large.jpg   // Large version
				c64b0d3cae2f874df24d21d00e49cdee_orginal.jpg // Original version
				
			> Note that, three version of ID above stored in DB as only one ID. 
			  That means you can store 1 million IDs like that too.
